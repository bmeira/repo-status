# Repository Status

Repository Status is a simple gnome extension to provide a very simple overview of git repositories. 
Currently only shows pull requests requiring approval on bitbucket repositories. Other functionalities, like support for multiple repositories, might be added later on. 

# Installation

For now, place the code on **~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/repo-status@kzd.homebrew.net**

# Development

### Pending issues/Further improvements [Version 1]

- ~~Configuration settings are not checked nor sanitized before usage~~
- ~~Configuration settings needs to be redesigned~~
- ~~Endpoints should be enum based~~
- ~~API call error handling needs specific errors (e.g.: authorization - a, etc.)~~
